# Surfs_Up

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to document and show the differences between the weather in June and in December in Hawaii in order to determine whether opening a surf and ice cream shop is feasable.

## Results

- The mean temperature between June and December only shifts about five degrees, from 74.9 in June, to 71.0 in December, meaning that it is not unlikely that the business could run successfully year-round.
- The high temperatures between June and December only diverge by two degrees, 85 in June, vs 83 in December, reinforcing the stability of the weather and, thus, the potential for consistency in temperature-related business.
- The minimum temperature does vary notably more, with an eight degree swing. 64 in June, and 56 in December. This signals that during moments of lower temperatures, such as evenings, rainier days, or weather events, the ice cream and surf shop may struggle more.

## Summary

Based on the weather data gathered, if the surf and ice cream shop could find a customer base based on the weather, it would be likely to keep it and to succeed, as the weather does not swing too far across the months. Something of great benefit to further this query would be to check for the prevalence of inclement weather as well as the levels of tourism to Hawaii during the months of the year in order to staff and prepare the business accordingly.
